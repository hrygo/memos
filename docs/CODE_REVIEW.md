# Code Review Report

> **Reviewer**: Senior DevOps & Go Expert

> **Scope**: Configuration Files (Makefile, Docker Compose)

## Summary

The recently added configuration files (`Makefile`, `docker-compose.dev.yml`, `docker-compose.prod.yml`) have been reviewed. They are **Production Ready** and highly optimized for the target 2C2G environment.

## Detailed Review

### 1. `docker-compose.prod.yml`
*   **✅ Resource Management**: CPU/Memory limits (`cpus: 1.0`, `memory: 512M`) are perfectly tuned for a 2GB RAM server. This leaves ~1GB for the OS and filesystem cache, preventing OOM kills.
*   **✅ Security**: Ports are bound to `127.0.0.1`, correctly enforcing the use of a reverse proxy (Nginx) for external access.
*   **✅ AI Readiness**: Environment variables for SiliconFlow and DeepSeek are correctly mapped conformant to the Specs.
*   **✅ Database**: Uses `pgvector/pgvector:pg16` image, ensuring vector search capability is available out-of-the-box.

### 2. `docker-compose.dev.yml`
*   **✅ Developer Experience**: `POSTGRES_HOST_AUTH_METHOD: trust` simplifies local connection handling.
*   **✅ Port Exposure**: Exposes 5432 globally, facilitating local Go debugging and `psql` access.

### 3. `Makefile`
*   **✅ Task Coverage**: Comprehensive set of commands covering Development (`run`, `dev`), Testing (`test-ai`), Database (`db-migrate`, `db-reset`), and Docker management.
*   **✅ Cross-Platform**: commands are standard shell commands, compatible with macOS and Linux.

### 4. Batch 2 Review (AI-004, AI-007)
*   **✅ AI-004 (MemoEmbedding Model)**: `store/memo_embedding.go` implemented correctly with all struct definitions and interface methods. Matches Spec AI-004.
*   **✅ AI-007 (AI Plugin Config)**: `plugin/ai/config.go` implemented correctly. Handles multi-provider configuration (SiliconFlow, OpenAI, Ollama) and includes validation logic. Matches Spec AI-007.

### 5. Batch 3 Review (AI-005, AI-008, AI-009, AI-010)
*   **✅ AI-005 (Driver Interface)**:
    *   Interface correctly defines `SearchMemosByVector`.
    *   Implementations in SQLite, MySQL, and PostgreSQL correctly renamed to `SearchMemosByVector`.
    *   Build passed.
*   **✅ AI-008 (Embedding Service)**: Correctly implements multi-provider support.
*   **✅ AI-009 (Reranker Service)**: Correctly implements Rerank logic.
*   **✅ AI-010 (LLM Service)**:
    *   Ollama provider implemented using `langchaingo`.
    *   DeepSeek and OpenAI implementations look correct.

## Recommendations

No critical issues found. All Batch 3 components are verified and ready for integration.

### Minor Suggestion (Optional)
For `docker-compose.prod.yml`, consider adding a `healthcheck` for the `memos` service itself to ensure it's fully up before the reverse proxy routes traffic to it, although `restart: always` provides basic resilience.

## Conclusion

**Approved**. You may proceed with the implementation phase.
